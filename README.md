# cs201G2T3

In the project directory **(/cs201)**, you can run:

### Install Maven

Install maven using homebrew `brew install maven` (MacOs only)

https://maven.apache.org/install.html Refer this link to install in windows or linux subsystem.

### `mvn package`

Compile codes into package and really for launch

### `java -cp target/cs201-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar sg.edu.smu.app.TestApplication`

Run the compiled package and launches the application

### `mvn install` 

Install the dependencies included in the POM.XML, complie codes into package and really for launch

### `mvn clean install`

Clear all installed dependencies and re-install the dependencies in the POM.XML. Complie codes into package and really for launch

There are three buttons in the application:

1. Connect - Find the shortest path between two given user. You can use the user list on the left side to enter the user id
2. Input Test[^1] - Test the different input graphs with BFS and Dijkstra Algo
3. Data Structure Test[^1] - Test how different data structures in Dijkstra Algo will affect the algorithm 

- Bottom Left is the user list
- Bottom Right will display the result of the action

[^1]:Do take note that if you selected a big dataset and a large number of time to run Input and Data Structure Test, the program will probably hang for a while as it takes sometime to compute the different test cases.

# Data
All data sets are stored inside the `data` Folder. 
Open `Userinterface.java` to change the dataset that you would like to test on and also the number of times to run the Input and Data Structure Test

Do take note that ajdacency matrix will take up a lot of memory space
Here is a table for memoery used for ajdacency matrix:
| Dataset | Number of Unique users | Estimated Heap Memory Used |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 100.json | ~10k | ~115MB |
| 300.json | ~32k | ~1042MB |
| 500.json | ~53k | ~2760MB |
| 1k.json | ~95k | ~9025MB |
| 5k.json | ~440k | ~19GB |
| 10k.json | ~821k | ~67GB |
| 250k.json | ~880k | ~77GB |

The default dataset used is `100.json`, you may based on your computer's capacity and select diffeent dataset for testing.
